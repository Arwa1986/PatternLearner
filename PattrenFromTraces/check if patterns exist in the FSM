after performing a possible merge, check if the merge:
        -lost one (or more) of the good patterns:
            meaning, before the merge there was a good merge, but after the merge the pattern was gone
            if yes, reduce the merging scour
        - obtains a bad pattern(s):
            meaning, one of the bad patterns appear in the FSM which wasn't there before
            if yes, reduce the merging scour
        - obtains a good pattern(s):
            meaning, one of the good patterns appear in the FSM which wasn't there before
            if yes, increase the merging scour
